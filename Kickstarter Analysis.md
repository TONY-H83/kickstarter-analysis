# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide Louise with a clear look at the trends related of past kickstarter events. One of the deliverables was to highlight what time of year has historically been the most successful. The other key piece of information needed from this analysis is to see how much she should set as her goal based off of previous successful and unsuccessful kickstarters. 
### Purpose
Louise just recently finiched a fundraising campaign and now wants to know how/why some campaigns are more successful than others. She initially tried to review historical data from past fundraising events but she quickly learned that there was an immense ammount of data but with everything being displayed in a raw linear chart, it was really just a lot of "noise" and painted no picture at all. She has asked me to drill into the data and organinze it in such a fashion she would quickly be able to understand the following:
- Funding amount goals
- Amounts pledged
- Campaign launch dates
## Analysis and Challenges
It was very clear what Louise wanted to deduce from the data set, the challenge was figuring out how to organize the data in an way that made sense and answered her questions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
